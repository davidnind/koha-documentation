Documentation for Koha using DITA XML
=====================================

## About this repository

This is an experimental repository to:
- Learn how to use DITA XML to create topic-based, modular, and reusable documentation.
- Test the feasibility of using DITA to create a core set of customisable documentation for the [Koha community] (koha-community.org).

## Status - as at 18 September 2014

Still in the early stages of setting up this project, nothing much to see here, yet.

Completed documentation available: none.
